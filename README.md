# Brian Portfolio

## Introduction:
Hello and thank you for visiting my GitHub Portfolio. Within this repository, I present a selection of my projects that I have undertaken as part of my Masters of Data Science and Analytics. For each project, you will see a description and links to corresponding code and reports. It's important to note that these projects are primarily academic in nature but offer an insight into my coding abilities.

With a current academic average of 84% I am on track to complete my Masters program in December 2023. I am currently completing my main project so this project will be updated several times over the next few weeks.

Please click on each Project to link to that repository to see more details.
