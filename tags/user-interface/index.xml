      <description>Progress: Starting in January 2024
Outline: Beginning in January 2024, this project focuses on building a simulated enterprise network to overcome the limitations of existing cybersecurity datasets. The aim is to create a more realistic network traffic analysis environment. This simulated network will facilitate the development and testing of real-time cybersecurity models.
Key Features:
Developing a controlled simulated network for detailed analysis of network behaviour. Generating a historic traffic profile to serve as a base for experiments and model training.</description>

      <description>Outline: The project responded to the growing number of cyberattacks like those seen with the HSE and MTU, which pose a significant threat to individuals and organisations. It&amp;rsquo;s core objective was to strengthen IDS by integrating Machine Learning Models to focus on real-time attack detection. The research was ground breaking in its comparative analysis of different Machine Learning models using data from the Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity. The architecture leveraged baseline models and Apache Kafka for real-time data processing to deploy various ML model at threat detection.</description>

      <description>Outline: This project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning models, specifically Logistic Regression and Random Forest. It begins with an introduction to the significance of healthcare data in transforming the medical industry, reducing waiting times, and improving patient care. The research integrates four heart disease datasets and explores feature selection techniques to enhance model performance. Practical application development is emphasized, allowing users to input their medical data for heart disease prediction using the best-performing model.</description>

      <title>Classifying Cats and Dogs with Machine Learning and Neural Network Models</title>
      <link>https://bhiggi01.github.io/Brian_Portfolio/post/project-12/</link>

      <guid>https://bhiggi01.github.io/Brian_Portfolio/post/project-12/</guid>
      <description>Outline: This project aims to develop a robust image classifier that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The project will begin with data preprocessing, including image resizing, normalization, and label encoding. Various machine learning and neural network models, such as logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), will be evaluated on a smaller sample dataset. Model performance will be assessed through validation accuracy.</description>
