      <description>Outline: This project aims to develop a robust image classifier that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The project will begin with data preprocessing, including image resizing, normalization, and label encoding. Various machine learning and neural network models, such as logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), will be evaluated on a smaller sample dataset. Model performance will be assessed through validation accuracy.</description>
