      <description>Outline: The project responded to the growing number of cyberattacks like those seen with the HSE and MTU, which pose a significant threat to individuals and organisations. It&amp;rsquo;s core objective was to strengthen IDS by integrating Machine Learning Models to focus on real-time attack detection. The research was ground breaking in its comparative analysis of different Machine Learning models using data from the Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity. The architecture leveraged baseline models and Apache Kafka for real-time data processing to deploy various ML model at threat detection.</description>

      <description>Outline: This project aims to develop a robust image classifier that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The project will begin with data preprocessing, including image resizing, normalization, and label encoding. Various machine learning and neural network models, such as logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), will be evaluated on a smaller sample dataset. Model performance will be assessed through validation accuracy.</description>

      <description>Outline: The project involves several key components. Firstly, the dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, laying the foundation for model development and evaluation. Challenges related to configuration and environment setup are addressed, and a baseline model is established, distinct from existing models. The architecture and purpose of each network layer are explained in plain language, and the training curves are thoroughly analyzed. Subsequently, the project explores the impact of parameter variations on model performance, such as the number of layers, filters, and nodes in fully connected layers.</description>

      <guid>https://bhiggi01.github.io/Brian_Portfolio/post/project-9/</guid>
      <description>Outline: This project aims to develop an effective email spam detection system specifically tailored for the ENRON email dataset. The project begins with data preprocessing, where the ENRON dataset is cleaned and structured. Next, a variety of machine learning models, including but not limited to Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, is implemented to classify emails as spam or legitimate. Feature engineering and selection techniques are employed to optimize model performance, and a comparative analysis is conducted to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each model.</description>
