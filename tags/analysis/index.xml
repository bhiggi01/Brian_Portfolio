      <description>Outline: This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a dataset from a maternity hospital, containing information on 250 single births, with variables like birth weight, gestational weeks, maternal age, and binary indicators for low birth weight, preterm birth, hypertension, and baby gender. The main objective is to explore the connections between birth weight and these variables. The report will begin with an introduction defining the research scope, followed by descriptive statistics to characterize the data.</description>

      <title>GDP &amp; Renewable Energy Relationship: A First Data Science Project</title>
      <link>https://bhiggi01.github.io/Brian_Portfolio/post/project-1/</link>

      <description>Outline: In my first data science project, I delve into the potential relationship between a country&amp;rsquo;s GDP and the proportion of its energy derived from renewable sources. This study also investigates regional disparities in renewable energy trends from 1970 to 2018. Leveraging three datasets - GDP, energy consumption, and regional information - I aimed to answer key questions regarding this nexus. The outcomes will provide valuable insights into the correlation between economic growth and sustainable energy adoption, while also showcasing my early venture into the realm of data science.</description>
