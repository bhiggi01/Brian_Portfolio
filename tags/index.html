    Outline: The project involves several key components. Firstly, the dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, laying the foundation for model development and evaluation. Challenges related to configuration and environment setup are addressed, and a baseline model is established, distinct from existing models. The architecture and purpose of each network layer are explained in plain language, and the training curves are thoroughly analyzed. Subsequently, the project explores the impact of parameter variations on model performance, such as the number of layers, filters, and nodes in fully connected layers.

    Outline: This project aims to develop an effective email spam detection system specifically tailored for the ENRON email dataset. The project begins with data preprocessing, where the ENRON dataset is cleaned and structured. Next, a variety of machine learning models, including but not limited to Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, is implemented to classify emails as spam or legitimate. Feature engineering and selection techniques are employed to optimize model performance, and a comparative analysis is conducted to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

    Shiny Dashboard: In this section, I developed an interactive Shiny app that facilitates data exploration and visualization of car data. The Shiny app allows users to choose any combination of two variables from the dataset and generates different types of plots based on the variable types. For numeric variables, a scatterplot is displayed. For a combination of a categorical variable and a numerical variable, a boxplot is shown. For two categorical variables, a barplot or count plot is generated.

    Outline: In my first data science project, I delved into the potential relationship between a country&rsquo;s GDP and the proportion of its energy derived from renewable sources. This study also investigated regional disparities in renewable energy trends from 1970 to 2018. Leveraging three datasets - GDP, energy consumption, and regional information - I aimed to answer key questions regarding this nexus. The outcomes provide valuable insights into the correlation between economic growth and sustainable energy adoption, while also showcasing my early venture into the realm of data science.

    Outline: Maeve, a manager at a financial institution, contacted me and asked to determine the credit worthiness of future customers for loans. She provided 807 past loan customers with 14 attributes, such as financial standing, reason for the loan, employment, years resident in the district, etc., with a classification of each case as either good or bad loans. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset, determined which attribute is the most important root node, and manually explored entropy and information using different methods.

    Outline: In my first data science project, I delved into the potential relationship between a country&rsquo;s GDP and the proportion of its energy derived from renewable sources. This study also investigated regional disparities in renewable energy trends from 1970 to 2018. Leveraging three datasets - GDP, energy consumption, and regional information - I aimed to answer key questions regarding this nexus. The outcomes provide valuable insights into the correlation between economic growth and sustainable energy adoption, while also showcasing my early venture into the realm of data science.
