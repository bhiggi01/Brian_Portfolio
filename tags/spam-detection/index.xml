      <description>Outline: This project aims to develop an effective email spam detection system specifically tailored for the ENRON email dataset. The project begins with data preprocessing, where the ENRON dataset is cleaned and structured. Next, a variety of machine learning models, including but not limited to Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, is implemented to classify emails as spam or legitimate. Feature engineering and selection techniques are employed to optimize model performance, and a comparative analysis is conducted to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each model.</description>
