      <description>Shiny Dashboard: In this section, I developed an interactive Shiny app that facilitates data exploration and visualization of car data. The Shiny app allows users to choose any combination of two variables from the dataset and generates different types of plots based on the variable types. For numeric variables, a scatterplot is displayed. For a combination of a categorical variable and a numerical variable, a boxplot is shown. For two categorical variables, a barplot or count plot is generated.</description>

      <description>Outline: Maeve, a manager at a financial institution, contacted me and asked to determine the credit worthiness of future customers for loans. She provided 807 past loan customers with 14 attributes, such as financial standing, reason for the loan, employment, years resident in the district, etc., with a classification of each case as either good or bad loans. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset, determined which attribute is the most important root node, and manually explored entropy and information using different methods.</description>

      <guid>https://bhiggi01.github.io/Brian_Portfolio/post/project-1/</guid>
      <description>Outline: In my first data science project, I delved into the potential relationship between a country&amp;rsquo;s GDP and the proportion of its energy derived from renewable sources. This study also investigated regional disparities in renewable energy trends from 1970 to 2018. Leveraging three datasets - GDP, energy consumption, and regional information - I aimed to answer key questions regarding this nexus. The outcomes provide valuable insights into the correlation between economic growth and sustainable energy adoption, while also showcasing my early venture into the realm of data science.</description>
